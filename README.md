<h1>Stock Market Analysis and Prediction</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The <i><b>"Stock Market Analysis and Prediction"</b></i> project seeks to help users grasp stock market intricacies better and enable them to make informed investment choices. Through the fusion of frontend and backend technologies it ensures a smooth user journey by offering predictions and valuable insights into stock market patterns.  
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
The main objective of this initiative is to provide investors with a decision-making tool that forecasts stock prices using data analysis. The frontend prototype model acts as the interface, for users offering a platform for interacting with the system. It can feature elements like visualizing data input forms and displaying results.
</p>

<p>
Behind the scenes the Linear Regression model is used to analyze stock data and predict trends. This model considers stock prices, trading volumes and other relevant factors to forecast price movements. Its accuracy and performance are assessed using metrics, like Mean Squared Error (MSE) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

  <li>Secondly, Download and Set up the XAMPP. Further, launch APACHE and MySQL server.</li>
  
  <li>Now, move to the python directory, run the run_all_streamlit_apps Windows Batch file and follow the required mentioned steps until all the streamlit apps are in running state in Command Prompt.</li>
  
  <li>Moreover, open Browser and run localhost/phpmyadmin and create a Database named as loginpage and further create three tables namely login, signup and watchlist according to the given structures provided in the Table Structure folder of this project.</li>
  
  <li>Further, Run localhost/{folder_name}/index.html in the browser and the landing page of the website will be in front of you.  [{folder_name}: Name of the folder in which the ZIP file is extracted eg. in this case, its PROJECT]</li>
